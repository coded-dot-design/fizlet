/**
 * fizlet/aim: where bots and turrets point and when they may fire. Bound once to body arrays (a
 * fizlet/actor's or a steer's `x`, `y`, heading `a`, velocity `vx`, `vy`) and, for line of sight, a
 * fizlet/grid board; then everything takes rows:
 * - `lead(i, j, speed)`: where i must shoot a shot of `speed` px/s to meet j, moving at (vx, vy):
 *   the intercept of a straight shot and a straight mover, the earliest one ahead;
 * - `cone(i, j, half, range)`: j inside i's heading ± `half` radians and within `range`;
 * - `sees(i, j)`: no `mask` cell strictly between them on the board (Bresenham, symmetric), or
 *   the game's own `clear(i, j)`;
 * - `pick(i, list, n, half, range)`: the nearest `foe` of i among list[0..n) in its cone and in
 *   sight (an actor table's `list` and `n` as they are).
 * Results land in `out[0..3]` ([x, y, t, d]: aim point, seconds to impact or the off-heading angle, and
 * distance), so no call returns a double: doubles returned or passed across a call V8 doesn't
 * inline are boxed. Distances are fizlet/steer's exact `hypot` (Math.hypot's bits, no heap
 * number). DOM-free, stateless between calls, zero allocation.
